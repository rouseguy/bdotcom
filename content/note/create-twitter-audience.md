[David Perell](https://twitter.com/david_perell) and [Matthew Kobach](https://twitter.com/mkobach) did a livestream on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/o9NxQ7aCUOw) on "How to Crush it on Twitter". Here are some notes from the seession.

**Who is the session for**   
Anyone who wants to create an audience on twitter.

**Why bother about Twitter**  

-   You can build a network solely based on your clarity and quality of your thoughts.  
-   Twitter is the instant writing improvement tool that has neer existed for mankind before.    
-   Twitter is the most amazing networking and learning network ever built - Bill Gurley.  
    

Twitter provides a continuous stream of information. One should be deliberate in his/her consumption choices. 99% of the people only consume. One should build the skill to synthesize the content that is being consumed. (More on this later).

**Random titbits**

-   Lots of people listen to podcasts. But long-form Speeches are under-rated. They have a linear fashion and strong story telling.
-   A good recommendation for a long-form speech is Charlie Munger's "The Psychology of Human Misjudgement".
-   They both loved James Clear's book: Atomic Habits. It has a lot of insights and is clearly influenced by writing on internet.
    

**How to write good tweet**  
-   *Compression*: Make the tweet as concise as possible.    
-   *Simplicity:* People don't read on twitter. They browse. Keep it simple.   
-   *Don't spam:* Definitely no hashtag. They feel spammy.   
-   *Smart:* Be kind, generous. Make people smarter with your tweet.   
-   *Novelty*: surprise the reader with new and interesting idea.   
-   *Follow*: The best way to write good tweet is also to follow great "tweeteers".   
-   *Read*: Read great tweeters.   
-   *Individuals*: follow individuals, not publications.   
-   *Infuencer*: Find one person you like and see who they follow, to build a list of great tweeters.      
-   *Cull*: Unfollow stressors and spammers.
        

**How to create a good twitter presence**

>   Matthew Kobach: People treat social media interactions the same way they treat real-life interactions. Helpful people are valued whereas self-serving people are ignored.
    
>   David Perell: If you want to improve your writing, start taking notes. Here's why: Note-taking isn't about saving ideas. It is about having conversations with your past and future self - so you can develop ideas over time.
    
-   Every tweet should have one idea.     
-   Lists are good and easy to read.  
-   On twitter, your presentation is as important as the content.  
-   Reply to people who have big followings. Ensure your reply adds lots of value to the conversation.
    

**Twitter Strategy**

-   Profile description matters.    
-   Answer Key strategy questions. 
    -   Why are you posting?  
    -   What are you trying to achieve?  
    -   You need clear goals on what success means . 
-   You need clear answers for the following:       
        -   Someone should follow me because <>   
        -   I will only post about <>, <> and <>    
        -   These are the regular content segments I will create to convey my key messaages: <>, <> and <>      
-   You have to be unbelievably niche. Start small.    
-   You need to post a lot.   
-   Start by posting continuously for 30 days.   
-   Analyze the data and see what resonated.   
-   The sum is greater than parts. Network effects kick in. Add value in every single tweet. Regularly.
        

**Summary**

-   Use internet to shrink the world.  
-   Be a lighthouse for like-minded people.
