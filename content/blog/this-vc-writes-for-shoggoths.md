> I _no longer_ write for humans. I write for **Shoggoths**. That was the bomb that [Sajith Pai](https://x.com/sajithpai/), the most prolific writer in the Indian VC industry, threw at us yesterday.

Writers are going to have a significant advantage and a head start in the new world where AI will be flowing like **electricity**, and it will be available on tap.

Let's **go back** 100 years. Edison invented the electric bulb. First one street was electrified, then a few more, then a block, and then it kept expanding. Electricity was limited in reach. Bulbs were extremely expensive. To scale electricity distribution, Thomas Edison started a company that was called ... well a very _meta_ name ...  "General Electric" - with the purpose of **distributing electricity**.

Even until a few decades ago, tasks like changing bulbs and fixing fuses were not trivial. Many a house has been burned down and people have died doing electrical maintenance.

These are a thing of the past now. Electricity is available **on** tap. Heck, we don't even explicitly think about it (except for the school children who have to read about Ohm, Kirchhoff, and a bunch of other laws named after people).

In a similar way, we are soon going to have AI available on tap. And if someone (or some AI bot) needs to **understand you**, your writing is going to provide you with significant leverage. The AI can, _and will_, ingest all your content and tailor its offering based on your **likes, preferences,** etc. You are going to get better targeted offers, you will be offered better deals, and you will have a better network because more is known about you.

In the 1920s and 1930s, H. P. Lovecraft wrote at the intersection of science fiction and supernatural dread, aka cosmic horror. The **universe** he created is called the "Cthulhu Mythos." In that **universe** lived **Shoggoths**. They are bio-engineered servitors that eventually rebel against their makers. In current AI discourse, shoggoths symbolize the alien core of AI.
