[David Perell](https://twitter.com/david_perell) and [Matthew Kobach](https://twitter.com/mkobach) did a livestream on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/o9NxQ7aCUOw) on "How to Crush it on Twitter". Here are some notes from the session.

**Who is the session for**  
Anyone who wants to create an audience on twitter.

**Why bother about Twitter**

- You can build a network solely based on your clarity and quality of your thoughts.
- Twitter is the instant writing improvement tool that has neer existed for mankind before.
- Twitter is the most amazing networking and learning network ever built - Bill Gurley.

Twitter provides a continuous stream of information. One should be deliberate in his/her consumption choices. 99% of the people only consume. One should build the skill to synthesize the content that is being consumed. (More on this later).

**Random titbits**

- Lots of people listen to podcasts. But long-form Speeches are under-rated. They have a linear fashion and strong story telling.
- A good recommendation for a long-form speech is Charlie Munger's "The Psychology of Human Misjudgement".
- They both loved James Clear's book: Atomic Habits. It has a lot of insights and is clearly influenced by writing on internet.

**How to write good tweet**

- _Compression_: Make the tweet as concise as possible.
- _Simplicity:_ People don't read on twitter. They browse. Keep it simple.
- _Don't spam:_ Definitely no hashtag. They feel spammy.
- _Smart:_ Be kind, generous. Make people smarter with your tweet.
- _Novelty_: surprise the reader with new and interesting idea.
- _Follow_: The best way to write good tweet is also to follow great "tweeteers".
- _Read_: Read great tweeters.
- _Individuals_: follow individuals, not publications.
- _Infuencer_: Find one person you like and see who they follow, to build a list of great tweeters.
- _Cull_: Unfollow stressors and spammers.

**How to create a good twitter presence**

> Matthew Kobach: People treat social media interactions the same way they treat real-life interactions. Helpful people are valued whereas self-serving people are ignored.

> David Perell: If you want to improve your writing, start taking notes. Here's why: Note-taking isn't about saving ideas. It is about having conversations with your past and future self - so you can develop ideas over time.

- Every tweet should have one idea.
- Lists are good and easy to read.
- On twitter, your presentation is as important as the content.
- Reply to people who have big followings. Ensure your reply adds lots of value to the conversation.

**Twitter Strategy**

- Profile description matters.
- Answer Key strategy questions.
  - Why are you posting?
  - What are you trying to achieve?
  - You need clear goals on what success means .
- You need clear answers for the following:
  - Someone should follow me because <>
  - I will only post about <>, <> and <>
  - These are the regular content segments I will create to convey my key messaages: <>, <> and <>
- You have to be unbelievably niche. Start small.
- You need to post a lot.
- Start by posting continuously for 30 days.
- Analyze the data and see what resonated.
- The sum is greater than parts. Network effects kick in. Add value in every single tweet. Regularly.

**Summary**

- Use internet to shrink the world.
- Be a lighthouse for like-minded people.
