There is a whole generation of children and young adults in India who are proficient only in English with very minimal local language exposure (bcoz... mandatory in school!).

These are from India 1 - parents are affluent and they attend a top school. Entertainment for them is k-pop and western series (netflix/prime/hotstar etc).

There is a niche market to create Indian English movies and TV series. They may be quite small right now - but that will grow to a sizeable number within a decade.

We had Nagesh Kukunoor make Hyderabad Blues in 1998. It was too early.

Time for a new generation of film-makers to cater to a new audience!
