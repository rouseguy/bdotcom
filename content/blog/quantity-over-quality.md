I often get questions on how to create short and quick projects. Specifically, I get this question even more: _Why should we build short and quick projects? Aren't we supposed to build mastery?_

To this, let me start with this story. One you might've heard before. But still, worth repeating and reading it again.


A semester-long pottery class meets on the first day. The professor splits the room cleanly down the middle: the left side will be graded on quantity, the right side on quality. 

• For the quantity group, the rules are, _right_, quantity - **make as many pots as possible**. 
• For the quality group, the rules are rigorous - ignore volume; **produce one, single, perfect pot**. You get the whole term to make that one amazing piece.

The quality group spends early weeks in the library, then the studio, outlining forms, sketching profiles, testing clays, arguing platonic ideals of curve and symmetry. They collect references and talk about the greats. There is much nodding. Much theorizing. 

Across the room, the quantity group is loud. Clay is everywhere. Their shelves fill with attempts - fat pots, thin pots, lopsided bowls that are hilarious. They overfire. They underfire. They crack things, then learn why cracking happens.

Then comes the last day. The professor weighs the piles on the left - some are quite comical and evaluates the single pieces on the right. BUT - the best work, the most graceful forms, the most confident lines, the most alive vessels, comes from the quantity side.

The group judged on sheer volume, through brute force of repetition, accidentally discovered the very refinement the other group had tried to think their way into. The quality group, in chasing the perfect pot, often produced pots that felt tight, overworked, and tentative.

The lesson is NOT that quality is unimportant; it is that quality emerges from quantity - from cycles of iteration, feedback, and small improvements placed over and over until your hands know more than your head.

In engineering, it’s the shape of abstractions; in product management, it’s the thousand little conversations that teach you where your value truly sits.

There’s also a quieter, psychological edge to the quantity side: fear dissipates in motion. When you know you’ll make the next pot tomorrow, you take risks today. When you only have one shot, every decision blooms with consequence, and consequence is a terrible collaborator.

Quantity builds a tolerance for error that paradoxically invites boldness - the exact thing great work needs.

**The pottery tale isn’t permission to be sloppy; rather it’s permission to be prolific**. Prolific people get to be selective later. They keep the ten best pots out of fifty because they made fifty. The selection is part of the craft. 

In that sense, the professor’s experiment is less about grading and more about metabolism: if you can metabolize mistakes quickly, quality becomes a side effect of your process rather than a standard you anxiously measure yourself against.
