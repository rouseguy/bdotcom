description: "I build AI products in healthcare. I love the creative power of individuals and small teams. I believe that the time has never been better to build a meaningful business. I am currently building a startup that helps healthcare providers enhance patient care using AI. I derive great joy from enabling people and organizations to embrace a data and AI-centric view. I facilitate industry-oriented workshops in the field of applied AI. I am currently trying to get better at deep work and be more thoughtful in life.
