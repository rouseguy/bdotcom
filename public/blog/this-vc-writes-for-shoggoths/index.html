<p>Writers are going to have a significant advantage and a head start in the new world where AI will be flowing like <strong>electricity</strong>, and it will be available on tap.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s <strong>go back</strong> 100 years. Edison invented the electric bulb. First one street was electrified, then a few more, then a block, and then it kept expanding. Electricity was limited in reach. Bulbs were extremely expensive. To scale electricity distribution, Thomas Edison started a company that was called &hellip; well a very <em>meta</em> name &hellip;  &ldquo;General Electric&rdquo; - with the purpose of <strong>distributing electricity</strong>.</p>
<p>Even until a few decades ago, tasks like changing bulbs and fixing fuses were not trivial. Many a house has been burned down and people have died doing electrical maintenance.</p>
<p>These are a thing of the past now. Electricity is available <strong>on</strong> tap. Heck, we don&rsquo;t even explicitly think about it (except for the school children who have to read about Ohm, Kirchhoff, and a bunch of other laws named after people).</p>
<p>In a similar way, we are soon going to have AI available on tap. And if someone (or some AI bot) needs to <strong>understand you</strong>, your writing is going to provide you with significant leverage. The AI can, <em>and will</em>, ingest all your content and tailor its offering based on your <strong>likes, preferences,</strong> etc. You are going to get better targeted offers, you will be offered better deals, and you will have a better network because more is known about you.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the 1920s and 1930s, H. P. Lovecraft wrote at the intersection of science fiction and supernatural dread, aka cosmic horror. The <strong>universe</strong> he created is called the &ldquo;Cthulhu Mythos.&rdquo; In that <strong>universe</strong> lived <strong>Shoggoths</strong>. They are bio-engineered servitors that eventually rebel against their makers. In current AI discourse, shoggoths symbolize the alien core of AI.</p>
