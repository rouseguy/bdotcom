A problem I&amp;rsquo;ve been grappling with is what, how, and how much to write on the website of the SaaS product. For a SaaS company, the website is pretty much its salesÂ copy. It is interesting and relevant to know how the market, and especially the competitors, present their sales copy.</description>
